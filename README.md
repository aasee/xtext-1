XText (see https://eclipse.org/Xtext/index.html) is a framework integrated with Eclipse, based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) which allows the user to create a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for a particular task. Examples of DSLs include SQL, HTML, JSON, among others.

Another example of a DSL is the Device Tree syntax used by Linux, a hardware description syntax. See the following:

This repo contains my expirementation using XText, some based on examples, and some of my own.
